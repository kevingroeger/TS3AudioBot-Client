## Serverside setup

[Back to Overview](#overview)

Make sure that your webserver is running, your ts3audiobot.toml should include the following code:
```$xslt
[web]
hosts = ["*"]
port = 58913

[web.api]
enabled = true
```
More information on this can be found [here](https://github.com/Splamy/TS3AudioBot/wiki/WebAPI).

## Configuration

[Back to Overview](#overview)

On first start, you need to configure your app.

### Base Url

Enter the full Url to your server here. It should have the following format:
`http(s)://<server>:<port>` without closing slash.

Eg. it could be one of the following:
```
http://localhost:56913
https://example.com:58913
http://116.203.238.192:58913
```

It is highly recommended to hit the save-button after entering or changing your url.

### Bot Config

Before entering any Bot Config, make sure you have successfully saved the correct Base Url.

After you've done that you can just press the download button on the right and your config will be automatically set.

If this does not work, you either entered the wrong Base Url, can't establish a connection to the server or you don't have any bots running.

This option can be customized. If you want to rename your bots you can just do it. Just make sure to not break the format or change the ids. Keep in mind that this will only change the name that is viewed to your client, not the name of the bot itself.
Eg. 
```
[{"name":"TS3AudioBot","id":0},{"name":"<MyCustomName>","id":1}]
```

After you've successfully entered correct values, for each bot a new tab will appear on your window.

### API Key

Altough it is not recommended; if you don't want to use api keys, you can edit your rights.toml to the following:
```$xslt
"+" = "*"
```

If you want to use api keys, just open a private chat to any bot on your TeamSpeak3 server, use the command `!api key` and paste the output into the api key field.

Make sure to save your configuration.
